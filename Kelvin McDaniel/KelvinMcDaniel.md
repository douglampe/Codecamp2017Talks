# Kelvin McDaniel's talk repo
Kelvin has blogged about his talk and posted a link for his slide deck there; you'll want to use that link. That way, when it is updated (for example, when the Cortana Skillls platform being brought out of private beta!) you'll always have access to the most recent version.
